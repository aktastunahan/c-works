This repo includes my work on learning some advanced topics using C language.

# HW1: Multithreading
Two different programs to count words in a given file. One counts the words
1.  Compile the source code using `make` command
2.  Run: `./pwords <file_path_1> <file_path_2> ... <file_path_n>`. For each file, a seperate thread counts the words.
